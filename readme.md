#  Destiny Image Scraper 

Destiny Image Scraper is a tool that can pull a image for anything that Bungie consider an item in Destiny 2. Super helpful for finding items for writing docs, creating thumbnails, and more!

##  How it Works 

On startup, the program automatically updates the database for items, to make finding items as easy as possible. The program pulls from Bungie API to download the icons for any item in the game.

##  How to Use Destiny Image Scraper

Using the program is pretty straightforward. Simply start typing the item you would like to add to the list, and click select item. It will add it to a list that you can download once you complete adding items.

##  Things to Keep in Mind

- It is recommended to put this program in its own folder, as it will create an `images` folder in whatever directory it is located in.
- There might be a delay between launching the program and the UI appearing. This is most likely caused by the software updating the item database.
